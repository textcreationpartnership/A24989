            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E arrived here on <hi>TueÅ¿day</hi> the 27th of <hi>May, Old Å¿tile,</hi> with Mr. <hi>JohnÅ¿ton,</hi> His MajeÅ¿ties Envoy extraordinary; and Mr. <hi>King,</hi> CommiÅ¿Å¿ioner for the InveÅ¿titure. The The Elector came hither PoÅ¿t on the <hi>Saturday</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, from <hi>Coningsberg.</hi> On <hi>Monday</hi> following, being the Å¿econd of <hi>June,</hi> the CommiÅ¿Å¿ioners had a privat Audience; at which they delivered the Credential Letters and Book of Statutes; after which they put on the Elector the <hi>Ribbon-Garter</hi> and <hi>George.</hi> âThey had likewiÅ¿e a privat Audience
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:30902:2"/>of Her Electoral HighneÅ¿s, of the PrinceÅ¿s ElectreÅ¿s, and of the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graff,</hi> and two other Princes, the Elector's Brothers. This they did for the diÅ¿patch, and that they might have the freedom of going to Court, and Å¿eing the adjuÅ¿ting of the States, and the putting of all other things in Order, againÅ¿t the time of the Solemn InveÅ¿titure. But they could not have a publick Audience, nor could the Ceremony of InveÅ¿titure be performed, till the Elector's Court, and his Coaches and HorÅ¿es Å¿hould arrive; which hapned on <hi>ThurÅ¿day</hi> night. In the mean time all other things were made ready, and the next day, being <hi>Friday</hi> the 6th of <hi>June,</hi> was appointed both for the publick Audience, and the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of InveÅ¿titure. The CommiÅ¿Å¿ioners were willing that theÅ¿e two Å¿hould be joined together, that no time might be loÅ¿t, nor the Elector's Journey to the <hi>Rhine</hi> Å¿topt Å¿o much as one moment, upon the account of the Solemnity.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Friday</hi> morning the Baron of <hi>Shiarm,</hi> the eldeÅ¿t Privy CounÅ¿el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, or MiniÅ¿ter of State (as they Å¿peak here) came from Court, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with a great many other Gentlemen, and particularly with MonÅ¿ieur <hi>BeÅ¿cat,</hi> (whoÅ¿e Office it was to regulat the Ceremony) all in Rich Cloaths, with Å¿ix of the Elector's Coaches, and Å¿ix HorÅ¿es in each of them, and carried the CommiÅ¿Å¿ioners and their Retinue to Court; twenty four <hi>Trabants,</hi> or HorÅ¿e-Guards, walking along all the way on both Å¿ides of the Coaches: Not to mention a great many of the Elector's Servants that did alÅ¿o attend them. At Court they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with Double Guards, and Colours DiÅ¿played, Twenty four Trumpets, and two pair of Kettle-Drums Å¿ounding all the while. The CommiÅ¿Å¿ioners Coach paÅ¿Å¿ed through the Inner-Court of the CaÅ¿tle; at the foot of the Stairs the CommiÅ¿Å¿ioners were received by the Grand MarÅ¿hal, with his Silver Staff of Office: At the head of the Stairs they were met by the Elector's Great Chamberlain, the Count of <hi>Denherff,</hi> and Å¿o were conducted to the Elector's Chamber; all the Rooms, as they paÅ¿s along, being full of the Nobility and Gentry of the Court, and the <hi>Trebants</hi> making the Guard up the Stairs, and along the two firÅ¿t Rooms.</p>
            <p>From the Elector's Apartment, they went to an Audience of the Electrice, where were all the Princes and PrinceÅ¿Å¿es of the Family, and the Ladies of the Court, richly dreÅ¿Å¿ed: Then they were conducted to the Rooms where the Robes of Order were before placed, where all
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:30902:2"/>things being in readineÅ¿s, they went to another Room near adjoining, in which his Electoral HighneÅ¿s was, and thence began the ProceÅ¿Å¿ion to the Great Hall, which is one of the nobleÅ¿t Rooms that is to be Å¿een any where, being above 100 foot long, and above 50 foot broad, adorn'd all about with the Marble Statues of the Electors of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and the Roof richly painted. They went in this Order: FirÅ¿t, The Nobility and Officers of the Court in great number; The Grand MarÅ¿hal and MarÅ¿hal with their Silver Staves of Office, being the laÅ¿t of them. Next came two belonging to the CommiÅ¿Å¿ioners, one of them carrying the King's CommiÅ¿Å¿ion, and the other the Cap and Feather; then followed Mr. <hi>Gregory King</hi> in the Mantle of the Kings at Arms, bearing the Habit and EnÅ¿igns of the Order on a Velvet CuÅ¿hion. Next came Mr. <hi>JohnÅ¿ton</hi> alone; and in the laÅ¿t place his Electoral HighneÅ¿s, attended by the Prince of <hi>Anhalt,</hi> and the Grand Chamberlain.</p>
            <p>Thus they went through a long Gallery (having the <hi>Trabants</hi> on each Å¿ide) into the Hall, and Å¿o into the Rails which divided the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per end of the Hall, that was raiÅ¿ed four Steps, making the due Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verences to the Soveraign's State; the Electrice, with the PrinceÅ¿Å¿es and Princes Ladies, and publick MiniÅ¿ters, having before taken their places within the Rails.</p>
            <p>The Elector being placed under his State, and the Robes being laid on a Table near his HighneÅ¿s, the two CommiÅ¿Å¿ioners Å¿eated themÅ¿elves in two armed Chairs, and the Trumpets and MuÅ¿ick ceaÅ¿ing, <hi>Mr. JohnÅ¿ton</hi> made a DiÅ¿courÅ¿e in <hi>EngliÅ¿h.</hi> But not to oblige the Elector to Å¿tand, becauÅ¿e of an hurt in his Leg, the Expedient fallen upon was this; That in Å¿tead of four DiÅ¿courÅ¿es (as the CuÅ¿tom is) two by one of the CommiÅ¿Å¿ioners, and two by one belonging to the Elector; that one only Å¿hould be made by Mr. <hi>JohnÅ¿ton</hi> in the beginning, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at the end of the Ceremony by MonÅ¿ieur <hi>Fulks,</hi> one of the Elector's MiniÅ¿ters of State. And therefore Mr. <hi>JohnÅ¿ton</hi> having put his two DiÅ¿courÅ¿es into one, and having only told the Å¿ubÅ¿tance of them in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliÅ¿h, he preÅ¿ented a TranÅ¿lation in <hi>High Dutch</hi> to the Elector, which he ordered his Chief Secretary to read; the Elector and the CommiÅ¿Å¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners having Å¿tood during the pronouncing of the EngliÅ¿h, but Å¿itting when the Dutch Copy was read. Then they preÅ¿ented the King's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miÅ¿Å¿ion to the Elector, which he gave to a MiniÅ¿ter of Å¿tate, who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>ãâã</desc>
               </gap> it to the Secretary to be read, the Elector and all others Å¿tand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:30902:3"/>up; which being again delivered to the Elector, his HighneÅ¿s gave it to Mr. <hi>King;</hi> After which, the CommiÅ¿Å¿ioners having taken off his HighneÅ¿s'<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> Coat, Sword, Belt, Ribbon George and Garter, Mr. <hi>John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ston</hi> inveÅ¿ted the Elector with the Diamond Garter, the Surcoat, the Sword and Belt, the great Mantle, the Hood, and at laÅ¿t the great Collar and George, in the order as they were delivered to him by Mr. <hi>King;</hi> who pronounced in Latin the uÅ¿ual Forms of Admonitions u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon Mr. <hi>Johnston's</hi> putting on the Elector each EnÅ¿ign. Then they preÅ¿ented to his Electoral HighneÅ¿s the Book of Statutes under the great Seal of the Order, and he delivered them Letters certifying his recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Order, and containing an Engagement to obÅ¿erve the Statutes with the uÅ¿ual Exceptions. TheÅ¿e Letters had already his Sign, and Seal at them, yet his Electoral HighneÅ¿s had a Pen given him, and he made a Å¿hew of writing his Name.</p>
            <p>Next they preÅ¿ented him with the Cap and Feather, which his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectoral HighneÅ¿s had enriched with Diamonds to the value of above 50000 <abbr>
                  <hi>l.</hi>
               </abbr> one of the Å¿tones coÅ¿t above 10000 <abbr>
                  <hi>l.</hi>
               </abbr>
            </p>
            <p>Then Mr. <hi>King</hi> did congratulate his Electoral HighneÅ¿s, and proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the Soveraigns and New-Knights Titles, upon which the Trumpets Å¿ounded, and the Drums beat, and MuÅ¿ick play'd.</p>
            <p>This being over, Mr. <hi>JohnÅ¿ton</hi> did alÅ¿o congratulate his HighneÅ¿s in in a Å¿hort Complement, and then MonÅ¿ieur <hi>Fulks</hi> made an handÅ¿ome Speech to the praiÅ¿e of the Soveraign and the Order. This Speech was in <hi>High-Dutch,</hi> that it might be underÅ¿tood by the whole AÅ¿Å¿embly; and a Copy of it being given to Mr. <hi>Stepney,</hi> Mr. <hi>Johnston</hi>'s Secretary, he read it publickly, the Elector and CommiÅ¿Å¿ioners Å¿itting all the while that MonÅ¿ieur <hi>Fulks</hi> Å¿poke, and that the Copy was read. Then they preÅ¿ented the Stars or Glories, and the Riboon of the Order; and returning to their Chairs, the Drums beat, the Trumpets Å¿ounded, and the Cannon round the Town was thrice diÅ¿charged. Then the Elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or and CommiÅ¿Å¿ioners returned in proceÅ¿Å¿ion as they came, and Mr. <hi>Norton,</hi> Collonel <hi>Norton</hi>'s GrandÅ¿on, he had the honour to carry the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector's Train.</p>
            <p>A little after this, they came back to the Hall again to Dinner, where his Electoral HighneÅ¿s and the two CommiÅ¿Å¿ioners only did Å¿it at the Table, his HighneÅ¿s being in the Robes, and the Court attending: The Elector began firÅ¿t the King's Health; 2dly, the Queen's; 3dly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

               </gap>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:30902:3"/>Knights of the Order; 4thly, ProÅ¿perity to the <hi>EngliÅ¿h</hi> Nation; 5thly, SucceÅ¿s to the Campaign. Mr. <hi>Johnston</hi> began firÅ¿t the Elector's Health; 2dly, the Electorices; 3dly, the Electoral Families; the Elector and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miÅ¿Å¿ioners Å¿tood up, and the Guns were diÅ¿charged at every GlaÅ¿s. After Dinner the CommiÅ¿Å¿ioners were carried home in the Å¿ame manner as they were brought in the morning; at night they returned to Court in two Coaches with Å¿ix HorÅ¿es, and Å¿upp'd with the Elector, the Electrice, and the PrinceÅ¿s, where many of the Å¿ame Healths were drunk again with the Å¿ame Ceremony of firing, and Å¿tanding up.</p>
            <p>After supper the Fire-works began, and were much admired by eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one, conÅ¿idering they had only three days to prepare them: There were many Rockets of all Å¿orts, and four great Fire-works of 40 or 50 foot high, the chief burnt blew, and was compoÅ¿ed of the repreÅ¿entati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Garter, having within it theÅ¿e four Letters, <hi>V. W. M. R.</hi> Å¿ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying <hi>Vivant Willielmus Maria Reges;</hi> and without the Garter were the Å¿upporting Crown and CreÅ¿t of <hi>England.</hi> The other three were Pyramids burning in bright white fire, with Crowns on the tops of them; the middlemoÅ¿t having the Letter B. and the other two, <hi>F.</hi> and <hi>H.</hi> Å¿ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying <hi>Britannia, Francia, Hibernia.</hi> The Elector hath ordered the Garter to be put on the Plate. Ever Å¿ince the publick Audience, we have been entertained at our Lodgings at the Elector's charge, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by his Officers. Both the CommiÅ¿Å¿ioners have received Rich PreÅ¿ents, the principal CommiÅ¿Å¿ioners being double the value of what was given to the other. The Servants of the firÅ¿t, to the number of 16, and thoÅ¿e of the other CommiÅ¿Å¿ioner, 3, had all conÅ¿iderable PreÅ¿ents according to their Å¿everal Offices. In a word, every thing was done for the honour of the Soveraign of it, and of the new Knight; and in a manner more noble than it could have been expected the Å¿hortneÅ¿s of time would have allow'd.</p>

Of theÅ¿e marks, the moÅ¿t eminent have been appropriated to Chevalry. Religion hath its TreaÅ¿ury above. JuÅ¿tice, and the other peaceable Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues without Arms, would be of little or no uÅ¿e. Therefore Military Glory, as moÅ¿t neceÅ¿Å¿ary, hath been preferr'd to all others; beÅ¿ides, it is acquired with greater danger, and is founded on nobler PaÅ¿Å¿ions.</p>
               <p>AmongÅ¿t all incitements to it, nothing hath proved Å¿o effectual as the InÅ¿titution of the Orders of Knights, Companions and Brethren.</p>
               <p>Such Orders do engage Princes by the Å¿tricteÅ¿t Ties of Honour, to give in their own PerÅ¿ons an example of Military Virtue, as alÅ¿o the higheÅ¿t Incouragement imaginable to follow it: For by theÅ¿e Fraterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties they deÅ¿cend from their GreatneÅ¿s, and conÅ¿ent, that brave and gallant Men Å¿hould be brought into a Å¿ort of Equality with themÅ¿elves.</p>
               <p>AmongÅ¿t Military Orders, there are none that can diÅ¿pute either An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity or Dignity with that of the Garter; which may indeed be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Mother Order, For the other great Orders have Å¿prung out of this Root, being formed upon the Model of it.</p>
               <p>Such InÅ¿titutions, like other things of the Å¿ame nature, in their firÅ¿t conceptions uÅ¿e to be imperfect, and calculated for receiving the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations that time only brings: But the Rules of this Order were from the beginning Å¿o well digeÅ¿ted, that they have admitted of few or no material Changes.</p>
               <p>To the Antiquity and WiÅ¿dom of the InÅ¿titution, <hi>I</hi> may add the ChaÅ¿tity of the Order: The Knights have at no time exceeded the firÅ¿t foundation of Twenty Å¿ix, contrary to the fate of other Orders, of which none have Å¿upported their Dignity as this hath done, conÅ¿idering joint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Å¿mal number, and Å¿ingular eminency of thoÅ¿e that have been of it, <hi>viz.</hi> Four hundred ninty Å¿even only. And yet amongÅ¿t theÅ¿e, there have been eight Emperors (of whom two, <hi>SigiÅ¿mond,</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> the Vth went to <hi>England</hi> and received it there, Å¿o much did they value the Honour of being of it;) Forty five Kings, including thoÅ¿e of <hi>England;</hi> and above Å¿ixty Princes, for the moÅ¿t part Soveraigns; Not to mention that the others generally deÅ¿erving to be Princes, were therefore by the Order in a manner made Å¿uch.</p>
               <p>The Qualities of <hi>Edward</hi> III. who founded this Order, gave a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar LuÅ¿tre to it; He was the GreateÅ¿t and BraveÅ¿t Prince of his Time, in the opinion of all others, as well as of the <hi>Germans,</hi> who firÅ¿t made Him Vicar-General of the Empire, and afterwards offered <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">

He claimed the Crown of <hi>France</hi> as his JuÅ¿t and Lawful Inheritance, and Å¿tudied by the InÅ¿titution of this Order, to engage the moÅ¿t mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Spirits of the Age, in his Quarrel. It was with his Garter that he gave the Signal at the Battel of <hi>CreÅ¿Å¿ey;</hi> remembering, it Å¿eems, that which was reported of one of his PredeceÅ¿Å¿ors, <hi>Richard</hi> the 1Å¿t, That he had upon a like occaÅ¿ion, with great SucceÅ¿s, made uÅ¿e of a Garter. In this Battel the whole Power of <hi>France</hi> fell before Him; upon which Augury he made the Garter the chief Sign of the Order. <hi>Richard</hi> the 1st, is alÅ¿o Å¿aid upon Å¿uch an account to have had the Å¿ame deÅ¿ign. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ides, a Garter is the Symbol and Badg of Unity, and therefore moÅ¿t proper to Å¿ignifie theÅ¿e Bonds of Amity and Affection, into which all the Companions were to reckon themÅ¿elves knit.</p>
               <p>He delighted much in Devices, and choÅ¿e for the Device of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, theÅ¿e words, <hi>Honi Å¿oit qui mal y PenÅ¿e;</hi> in <hi>EngliÅ¿h, May he be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hamed that thinks ill</hi> (or does not approve) <hi>of it.</hi> That is, either of the Order it Å¿elf, or of his Title to the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> which gave occaÅ¿ion to the InÅ¿titution.</p>
               <p>He made <hi>Blew</hi> the chief Colour, that being the Colour of the Field of the Arms of <hi>France,</hi> which, with the Title he had about that time aÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿umed to himÅ¿elf, his SucceÅ¿Å¿ors have ever Å¿ince uÅ¿ed: BeÅ¿ides, <hi>Blew</hi> denotes the Sublime and CeleÅ¿tial Temper of thoÅ¿e who were to be of the Order. The Pilgrims that returned from the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> brought over Å¿uch an account of St. <hi>George</hi> (then the <hi>ChriÅ¿tian Mars</hi>) particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly of his Tutelary care of the <hi>EngliÅ¿h</hi> in that War, that according to the PerÅ¿uaÅ¿ions of thoÅ¿e Times, he made him the Patron of the Order, as well as of the Nation.</p>
               <p>He wiÅ¿ely conÅ¿idered that other Sovereign Princes might think it a leÅ¿Å¿ening of them, to come into an Order Å¿ubject to the Laws and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>England;</hi> therefore he intirely Å¿eparated its Concerns, and made it a diÅ¿tinct Body with Seals and Officers, and Statutes peculiar to it; over which the Seals and Laws of <hi>England</hi> have no Å¿ort of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
               <p>This is the Order, <hi>Sir,</hi> Å¿o deÅ¿ervedly famous over all ChriÅ¿tendom, theÅ¿e Three hundred and forty Years, of which we have now the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, in the Name of the King our MaÅ¿ter, to PreÅ¿ent Your Electoral HighneÅ¿s the EnÅ¿igns. The Å¿ame Order which His HighneÅ¿s, Your Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luÅ¿trious Father, deÅ¿ired Å¿o much, and received as a great Honour done
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:30902:5"/>him, and to which he did great Honour: He wore it in a time of Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when the Fate not only of the <hi>North,</hi> but of the whole Empire; nay, I may add, of all <hi>Europe,</hi> turned according to the MeaÅ¿ures that he took, and which is more, turned often with the approbation of all good men. It was thus that he run his Career, which he finiÅ¿hed with an happineÅ¿s that might be called <hi>the obtaining of the Prize,</hi> if that were to be done here; For he being full of Honour and Years, in Peace and Quiet, Belov'd and EÅ¿teem'd by the better part of Mankind, died; leaving behind him the only Two things to be left, a Great and Good Name, and a Glorious SucceÅ¿Å¿or.</p>
               <p>It is alÅ¿o the Å¿ame Garter, as well as the Å¿ame Order, with which we are to inveÅ¿t your HighneÅ¿s. This I Å¿hould call a happy <hi>Omen,</hi> that the Order is Å¿till to receive the Å¿ame Honour: But your HighneÅ¿s hath not left the World to Divination and Conjecture; you have begun your Regence in a way worthy of the Son of Å¿uch a Father, and already given Mankind real inÅ¿tances of that which they may expect: And now this day you are to put the Order in poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ion of the Honour which you have, as it were, advanced to it, and to which the Order hath a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Claim, your HighneÅ¿s having acquired the Å¿ame, as the Founder did his, by defeating the acient Enemies of both Nations. For this ReaÅ¿on, I Å¿uppoÅ¿e, the King, my MaÅ¿ter, as well as for doing your HighneÅ¿s greater Honour, hath Å¿ent you a Sword, amongÅ¿t the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿igns of the Order, which hitherto was never done to any other.</p>
               <p>Sir, Nothing is more evident than that this Society was inÅ¿tituted for carrying on a War with <hi>France,</hi> in which War, the Emperor, the Princes of <hi>Brandenburg, Bavaria, Lorrain,</hi> and many others, were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged by a Confederacy with the Founder of this Order, as your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s, and others, their SucceÅ¿Å¿ors, are now with the preÅ¿ent Soveraign of it. It Å¿eems in all Ages it hath been the WiÅ¿dom of Great Princes to have no other thing to do with that Crown. Sure that which hath hapned in this Age, doth not alter the CaÅ¿e; nay, the preÅ¿ent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy is a DemonÅ¿tration, that it is the SenÅ¿e of Mankind, that the Publick quiet can be no longer Å¿ecured by the Faith of Treaties; and therefore, that a firm Peace is only to be obtained by a thorough War: For Men that having enriched themÅ¿elves by Violence, are fallen in love with it, will love on till they loÅ¿e by it, then it will be Å¿eaÅ¿onable.

                  <hi>Edward</hi> the 3d deÅ¿igned a ConqueÅ¿t, and Å¿ucceeded in it: But there is here place for yet a more Noble DeÅ¿ign, that of a Redemption. The Work of an <hi>Hero</hi> is not to mind his own BuÅ¿ineÅ¿s only, much leÅ¿s to do hurt, to plunder the World with <hi>Alexander,</hi> or ruine his own Countrey with <hi>CaeÅ¿ar;</hi> but to do good chiefly to others; to chain up the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿turbers of the Publick Peace, to Å¿et Bounds to Exorbitant Power, and the Will of Man; <hi>and Å¿o to deÅ¿erve the BleÅ¿Å¿ings of thoÅ¿e that were ready to periÅ¿h. All this the King, my MaÅ¿ter, hath done, by redeeming his own Countrey from Ruine, and other Countreys from the danger of it,</hi> in Å¿uffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to become his own: <hi>Thus endeavouring every where to Å¿tem the Inundations of the preÅ¿ent Times, as his Ancestors did thoÅ¿e of theirs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to this, not only the Example of the Soveraign invites thoÅ¿e of the Order, but the Order it Å¿elf, in a particular manner, engages them, <hi>Pugnare pro jure &amp; tuitione oppreÅ¿Å¿orum &amp; indigentium,</hi> To fight for the relief of the poor and the oppreÅ¿Å¿ed.</p>
               <p>This, ReaÅ¿on, Humanity, common ChriÅ¿tianity, and IntereÅ¿t too, requires of all Men, much more of Princes, that are to act as Gods Vicegerents, who Glories in nothing oftner than in his firm purpoÅ¿es to avenge and Protect Widows and Orphans, and Å¿uch others, the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, though Unfortunate part of Mankind, to wit, by commanding all thoÅ¿e that have power to do it, to puniÅ¿h their OppreÅ¿Å¿ors.</p>
               <p>Thus it is here, That a Capacity to do good, not only gives a Title to it, but makes the doing of it a Duty. It is Å¿trange, That among ChriÅ¿tians in all Times there Å¿hould have been Å¿ome who doubted of this, and have had narrower Thoughts of Heroical Enterprizes than either the <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Heathens</hi> had; nay, of whom Å¿ome have believ'd all War to be unlawful, Å¿ince the DeÅ¿ign of ChriÅ¿tianity was to exalt our Natures to a higher and Å¿ublimer pitch of Perfection, and not to Å¿tifle and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do, with Å¿pecious pretences, that which is moÅ¿t Commendable in them, the Inclinations and Ties we may have to do one another good.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> of old had Å¿o Noble an Opinion of Å¿uch Performances, that they imputed them to InÅ¿piration; they thought, that without extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary AÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tances, Men had neither GoodneÅ¿s nor LargeneÅ¿s of Soul Å¿ufficient for them.</p>
               <p>It is true, Å¿everal among them endeavoured thus to defend the Irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities that Å¿ometimes did accompany Å¿uch Actions, and Å¿uppoÅ¿ed an expreÅ¿s Order from God<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> as neceÅ¿Å¿ary to juÅ¿tifie them. Yet Rules and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:30902:6"/>Laws are means for obtaining the ends which they relate to, and in that relation cannot be too well obÅ¿erved; but they are not the ends them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves which muÅ¿t Å¿till be purÅ¿ued, tho in another way, if the ordinary way fails. No doubt the Letter of the Law, that upon great occaÅ¿ions oppoÅ¿es it Å¿elf to the publick Safety, which is intended by all Laws, muÅ¿t needs be the Letter that kills. This thoÅ¿e high Pretenders came at laÅ¿t to underÅ¿tand (and to fight even on their <hi>Sabbaths</hi>) tho their Laws were given them by God; and that it was their humour to Å¿wallow Camels, and Å¿train at Gnats; to let go the SubÅ¿tance for the Law, and periÅ¿h in defence of the Letter of it. The true Å¿tanding Character in all Ages and Nations, and ordinarly the Fate too, of Weak, and Warm, and ObÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate (tho often Well meaning) Men.</p>
               <p>ThoÅ¿e <hi>Jews</hi> are much more in the right, who aÅ¿cribe great Events more particularly to God, becauÅ¿e of that which is Å¿ingular (as well as of his Concern) in them. Thus they would, no doubt, judge of the late Revolution in <hi>Britain,</hi> where we have an IlluÅ¿trious Example of Å¿uch Å¿orts of Events. In which the concurrence of great Dangers, of an unexpected Opportunity to be delivered from them; of the Capacity and CircumÅ¿tances of the Deliverer, as if they had been given for this End; of the evident infatuation of thoÅ¿e, whoÅ¿e IntereÅ¿t (and in whoÅ¿e Power) it was to have prevented it; of a multitude of meer Accidents previous and abÅ¿olutly neceÅ¿Å¿ary to it, which by Humane WiÅ¿dom could neither have been forÅ¿een nor procured: In aword, of a Chain and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incidency of various, and often, in appearance CroÅ¿s Events, yet in effect, Å¿o well agreeing with the Methods reÅ¿olved on, that Divine GoodneÅ¿s and Humane Prudence Å¿eem to have had a CorreÅ¿pendence. All this, with the Å¿udden vaniÅ¿hing of Difficulties that had appear'd, in a manner inÅ¿uperable, and a SucceÅ¿s worthy of the Care of Providence (Å¿uch as HiÅ¿tory cannot parallel) without Blood, Danger, or DiÅ¿order; So <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

An Undertaking Å¿uch as Humane Nature requires, where Honour, and Duty, and IntereÅ¿t go hand in hand together: And the moÅ¿t neceÅ¿Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing to be done, is the greateÅ¿t and beÅ¿t thing that can be done.</p>
               <p>In particular, it is an Undertaking that will tranÅ¿mit your HighneÅ¿s Name glorious to PoÅ¿terity: for you firÅ¿t gave life and motion to it, by Å¿aving the Town of <hi>Cullen,</hi> and that whole Electorat, by taking <hi>KeiÅ¿erÅ¿wert, Rhinberg</hi> and <hi>Bonn;</hi> by routing the Forces Å¿ent to aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿t them, and Å¿o delivering the <hi>Lower Rhine</hi> from the Chains that in time muÅ¿t have prov'd thoÅ¿e of the Empire.</p>
               <p>Sir, You have thus out-done the Enemy in Diligence, their moÅ¿t commendable Quality, if it were well imploy'd: You have overcome them, where they themÅ¿elves, and others too, think them moÅ¿t invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible, behind Walls: You have defeated their Troops, neither by num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber nor Å¿urprize; Advantages are to be taken; but it is greater not to Å¿tand in need of them.</p>
               <p>Thus your HighneÅ¿s hath begun the War, where it muÅ¿t end with Victory, and taken to your Å¿elf a Å¿hare in it Å¿uitable to the Dignity of your Family, and the importance of the Conjuncture, which gave your HighneÅ¿s the opportunity to Signalize the beginnings of your Regence by doing the publick Å¿uch eminent Services; as if Providence, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:30902:7"/>with the Integrity of your Intentions, took care, that no Å¿ooner you Å¿hould be in a capacity to do good, but that the Publick Å¿hould require and receive the benefit of it, to Å¿ignifie to your HighneÅ¿s, that the good of the Publick ought to be the end of your GreatneÅ¿s, and to others, That it is the end, and will be Å¿o.</p>
               <p>Sir, The great Power that God has put in your Hands, can at no Time be better imployed. Without ControverÅ¿ie, the Peace and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineÅ¿s of <hi>Europe,</hi> during this Age, depends upon the SucceÅ¿s of this War.</p>
               <p>All Laws, Divine and Humane, of Peace and War, the Fences of the publick Sufety are broke thorough; ThoÅ¿e eternal Dictates of ReaÅ¿on, the obligations of Honour, Humanity, Oaths, PromiÅ¿es, Religion, as well as the CuÅ¿toms of Nations, which the NeceÅ¿Å¿ities of Humane Affairs have rendred inviolable, and without which the great Society of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind can no more Å¿ubÅ¿iÅ¿t, than privat Societies can without Rules and Laws: All theÅ¿e have been openly and avowedly trampled on.</p>
               <p>Now if the Ambition, and other PaÅ¿Å¿ions of Men that have done Å¿uch things, have carried them Å¿o far, notwithÅ¿tanding the juÅ¿t apprehenÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which, no doubt, they had of a general reÅ¿entment; whither will the Å¿ame paÅ¿Å¿ions not carry them, if the preÅ¿ent Confederacy Å¿hould hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to be fruÅ¿trated, and there Å¿hould remain nothing more for them to be afraid of.</p>
               <p>But better things, no doubt, are reÅ¿erved for this Age. The Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot Wheels of thoÅ¿e that have asked Brick, and forbid Straw, begin already to move heavily. And provided the <hi>eaÅ¿terly</hi> Wind continue to blow Å¿teady, and neither little privat IntereÅ¿ts, (Å¿ure little in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariÅ¿on) nor certain points of Honour (only tolerable when Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent) diÅ¿order the preÅ¿ent Harmony, the event is infallible.</p>
               <p>Sir, Nothing can contribute more to this than the happy Union that is between the King my maÅ¿ter, and your Electoral HighneÅ¿s, which Å¿tates His MajeÅ¿ty, and your HighneÅ¿s, in the beÅ¿t CircumÅ¿tances ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable for preventing or removing differences.</p>
               <p>This, among other ReaÅ¿ons, gives ground to hope, that the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy is not to be broke, Å¿ince the Union I Å¿peak of cannot be diÅ¿Å¿olv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. It is Å¿trong, by all that is Sacred amongÅ¿t men, the Ties of Honour, Religion, Blood, FriendÅ¿hip, Obligations, Engagements, and I may add of the Å¿ame IntereÅ¿ts and DeÅ¿igns, with relation to the Publick.</p>

The Excellency whereof is viÅ¿ible, by thoÅ¿e two things that are abÅ¿olutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in every true Knight, which are, not to have been tainted of any BaÅ¿eneÅ¿s, or of any Cowardize. But the Dignity of this Order his been Å¿o fully Å¿hewn by His MajeÅ¿ties Envoy, that 'twold be Å¿uperfluous to add any thing to what
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:30902:8"/>he has Å¿aid. Indeed in the ancient HiÅ¿tories of the</hi> Greeks <hi>and</hi> Romans, <hi>many Examples may be found, where Kingdoms and Provinces have been given away to others by the PoÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ors thereof; but DeÅ¿ert and Right were not always the CauÅ¿e of Å¿uch Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations. They were oftner made by blind Chance or Favour, or elÅ¿e ReaÅ¿ons of State were the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caÅ¿ions of them. But that Honour which is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded only on Merits, and which proceeds from a true and Å¿olid conÅ¿ideration of Worth only, is to be preferred above Scepters and Crowns. And the conferring of this Noble Order muÅ¿t be thus looked upon, Å¿ince it is done by a King who does nothing but with an exact knowledge and mature deliberation. For altho his Electoral HighneÅ¿s could not but have always thought it an Honour to have been of this Order, yet he looks upon it as greater Å¿till in this, That the Dignity is conÅ¿erred upon him by his preÅ¿ent MajeÅ¿ty of</hi> Great Britain. <hi>The Diamonds and Gold which Å¿hine on the Badges thereof, receive yet a greater luÅ¿tre from Å¿o glorious a Hand, which the Divine Providence has made choice of to render this Age famous even for Miracles, to be a terror and chaÅ¿tiÅ¿ment to Tyrants, to deliver the oppreÅ¿Å¿ed, raiÅ¿e up thoÅ¿e that were fallen, reÅ¿tore thoÅ¿e that are driven out, to Å¿tabliÅ¿h Tottering Crowns, and which having already freed Two Kingdoms, will in all probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity gloriouÅ¿ly recover a Third in a Å¿hort time. Things that come from Å¿uch an auguÅ¿t hand can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be of excellent Vertue and Effect. His in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable Valour and Courage, and the bleÅ¿Å¿ing of Heaven, have had this great effect, that the moÅ¿t Famous Nations in the World, have put</hi> Four Crowns <hi>on his Head, and on that of his Royal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ort, adorned likewiÅ¿e with all the Å¿ame Vertues and Perfections. Which Crowns, in Å¿tead of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding any Ornament to the PerÅ¿ons that are poÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ed of them, become more IlluÅ¿trious from the heads of thoÅ¿e that wear them. His Electoral HighneÅ¿s was the firÅ¿t of any Forreign Prince that has received this Noble Token of Favour from His Royal MajeÅ¿ty. From whence his HighneÅ¿s cannot but acknowledge, That tho His Royal Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeÅ¿ty, and his Electoral HighneÅ¿s, were before nearly Related, His Royal MajeÅ¿ty has thought fit to make Å¿till a cloÅ¿er Union, 'Tis not to be queÅ¿tion'd but that it proceeds from the Secret Providence of God; That as this Order was inÅ¿tituted by</hi> Edward <hi>the Third, eÅ¿pecially againÅ¿t the</hi> French, <hi>who then, as at preÅ¿ent, began to Å¿trive for the UniverÅ¿al Monarchy, Å¿o now is conferr'd by</hi> Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam <hi>the Third, on</hi> Frederwick <hi>the Third, at a
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:30902:8"/>time when they Two firÅ¿t of all diÅ¿played their Colours for the Freedom of</hi> Europe, <hi>and with U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited Forces, oppoÅ¿ed ThemÅ¿elves to that mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿trous and dreadful Enemy, rendring the Thing more Ominous, by the Badge which this Order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makes uÅ¿e of,</hi> Honi Å¿oit qui maly penÅ¿e. <hi>Let him periÅ¿h Å¿hamefully who dares raÅ¿hly deÅ¿piÅ¿e this inÅ¿eparable Alliance. To this without doubt, His Royal MajeÅ¿ty had regard, when He Å¿ent the Sword to His Electoral HighneÅ¿s, which otherwiÅ¿e relates not to the Badges of the Order, and was never before conferred on any Knight; and with which he would have him girt with Å¿o great Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, that he might make uÅ¿e of it in his Wars, for the aÅ¿Å¿erting the Freedom of</hi> Europe. <hi>His Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoral HighneÅ¿s certainly deÅ¿igns to do that which His MajeÅ¿ty intended by conferring this Honour on him, and will always think himÅ¿elf Å¿o Å¿trictly united to His MajeÅ¿ty, that no Force nor Artifice Å¿hall ever be able to break the Union: But he will e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿teem whatever Fortune whether bad or good, that attends his MajeÅ¿ty, to be the Å¿ame as if it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd to his HighneÅ¿s, making no other difference betwixt his MajeÅ¿ties Concerns and his own, than to give thoÅ¿e of his MajeÅ¿ty the firÅ¿t place. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, his Electoral HighneÅ¿s will never render himÅ¿elf unworthy the Honour conferred, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the Statutes of the Order. And becauÅ¿e his Electoral HighneÅ¿s is now become one of the Members of the Order, inÅ¿tituted amongÅ¿t the</hi> EngliÅ¿h <hi>Nation, his HighneÅ¿s will always endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to promote their IntereÅ¿t and Glory, LaÅ¿tly, His HighneÅ¿s thanks the CommiÅ¿Å¿ioners, in that they have been pleaÅ¿ed to undertake the confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this Noble PreÅ¿ent on him, and thanks his Royal MajeÅ¿ty for having choÅ¿en them for this Solemnity, to whom his Electoral HighneÅ¿s will on all occaÅ¿ions Å¿hew all Favour and EÅ¿teem.</hi>
